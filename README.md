# Threat Modeling Language - Master's Thesis
## Overview
This repository contains the thesis for the Master in Computer Science (Informatica), which explores how modeling during threat modeling can be supported to document design decisions and their corresponding reasoning without hindering the modeling process.
## Research Question
How can modeling during threat modeling be supported to document design decisions and their reasoning without impeding the modeling process?
## Solution Approach
To address this question, an event-driven Domain-Specific Language (DSL) called Threat Modeling Language (TML) was developed. This DSL allows users to:
- Construct Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) for threat modeling.
- Document design decisions and their reasoning directly within the modeling process.
- Link the documented reasoning to specific DSL statements.
## Technologies Used
The implementation of Threat Modeling Language utilizes:
- Eclipse Xtext for DSL development.
- Graphviz for visualization of generated models.
## Repository Structure
- /src - Source code for the DSL implementation.
- /research - Documents and related research materials
- /examples - Sample threat models created using TML.
